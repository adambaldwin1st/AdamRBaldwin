                        <p>FPL Ultimate began as a website that initially scraped data from the
                            official Fantasy Premier League (FPL) website to present player stats
                            and other relevant information in a more organized and user-friendly
                            way. Eventually, it evolved into a standalone project that is currently
                            in development. I am expanding its features to emulate existing fantasy
                            American football sites, which includes my own scoring system.
                            <br><br>
                            In my opinion, the existing products in this market are severely
                            lacking and I have set my sights higher.</p>

                        <p>I often create sets of trivia questions to host family trivia nights.
                            I am a big fan of trivia challenges, and wanted to expand on my ability
                            to host these nights. I was inspired by asymmetric games like jackbox.tv
                            and sought to create my own version using my trivia questions. Buzzed
                            Trivia can be run in 'Hosted' and 'Non-Hosted' modes to allow for many
                            ways to play. Users can log in to a common trivia room using a room code
                            and participate in the trivia challenge. The project is still in
                            development.</p>

                        <br>Software Developer II -- Oct. 2024 - Present</p>
                        <p>Bandwidth hired me as an intern during my final year in college.
                            I was put on a team that was developing an experimental video chat
                            application using WebRTC. This was a pivotal opportunity in my career
                            as I was able to jump into my new job before I even finished my degree.
                            I was hired full-time in the summer after my graduation.
                            <br><br>
                            Shortly thereafter, my team was moved from WebRTC to the biggest
                            moneymaker of the company: Messaging. In our new department, we were in
                            charge of building out APIs for tracking the provisioning data for
                            various channels of automated text messaging. During my work here I
                            have gained valuable experience in developing services that aggregate
                            data from multiple external parties and are independently deployed.
                            <br><br>
                            I will always be thankful to Bandwidth for taking a chance on me as a
                            self-taught programmer right out of college.</p>

                        <p>I joined CapTech Consulting as an intern for the Summer of 2021. I was
                            placed on a team with 11 other interns and tasked with creating a
                            web-based application. The application's purpose was to track items in
                            a user's pantry and fridge and make suggestions for recipes based on
                            what is available. The CapTech intern program team did a fantastic job
                            of simulating a real-world consulting environment for creating the
                            application. I took charge of the API layer of the application to
                            interface with the frontend, the database, and the external image
                            recognition software that we utilized. Additionally, I configured the
                            EC2 that our application was hosted on.
                            <br><br>
                            My experience at CapTech was invaluable. I learned countless
                            professional development tips during my time there, and am very glad
                            to have been a part of such a great intern program.</p>

                            <br>Software Development Intern -- Summer 2019
                        </p>
                        <p>My very first software development job was an internship at a company called CSRA. By the
                            time I started, CSRA had been acquired by GDIT. As part of that internship, I gained my
                            first experience with AWS. I worked with the other interns to create a web-based application
                            for converting VMWare virtual machines to KVM virtual machines for internal use.
                            <br><br>
                            During my time at GDIT, I was assigned a mentor. My mentor was a wealth of professional
                            advice. She went above and beyond by securing me a subsequent internship in her department,
                            Rapid Application Development, for the following summer. During my time with RAD, I
                            overhauled the frontend portion of a portal used by GDIT’s subcontractors to track their
                            employee certifications. As part of this, I had to make modifications to the underlying SQL
                            database that stored the information.
                            <br><br>
                            My time at GDIT was easily my most formative time as a software developer, and I owe much
                            of my success to the people generous enough to help me along the way.</p>

                        <p class="subtitle is-6 is-italic">Publicity Chair -- May 2017 - May 2019</p>
                        <p>I joined the Student Engineers’ Council at the end of my freshman year at Virginia Tech.
                            I joined as the Publicity Chair, which meant I was in charge of advertising every event
                            hosted by the council, managing the social media presence, and creating any and all graphics
                            or art related to the SEC.
                            <br><br>
                            However, the majority of my responsibilities came from the responsibilities of the council
                            as a whole. Most notably, the Student Engineers’ Council hosts Engineering Expo, the
                            engineering job fair at Virginia Tech. During my time with the council, this was the largest
                            student-run engineering career fair in the country. On top of that, the SEC was in charge of
                            dividing up $140,000 per year to design teams, engineering organizations, and the
                            engineering faculty.
                            <br><br>
                            My time with the council was a nonstop combination of fun and challenging, and I am very
                            thankful for the opportunity to have contributed. While not technically a job, I owe a great
                        deal of my professional development to the SEC.</p>
