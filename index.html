                        <p>FPLUltimate began as a website that initially scraped data from the
                            official Fantasy Premier League (FPL) website to present player stats
                            and other relevant information in a more organized and user-friendly
                            way. Eventually, it evolved into a standalone project that is currently
                            in development. I am expanding its features to emulate existing fantasy
                            American football sites, which includes my own scoring system.
                            <br><br>
                            In my opinion, the existing products in this market are severely
                            lacking and I have set my sights higher.</p>

                        <p>I often create sets of trivia questions to host family trivia nights.
                            I am a big fan of trivia challenges, and wanted to expand on my ability
                            to host these nights. I was inspired by asymmetric games like jackbox.tv
                            and sought to create my own version using my trivia questions. Buzzed
                            Trivia can be run in 'Hosted' and 'Non-Hosted' modes to allow for many
                            ways to play. Users can log in to a common trivia room using a room code
                            and participate in the trivia challenge. The project is still in
                            development.</p>

                        <p>Bandwidth hired me as an intern during my final year in college.
                            I was put on a team that was developing an experimental video chat
                            application using WebRTC. This was a pivotal opportunity in my career
                            as I was able to jump into my new job before I even finished my degree.
                            I was hired full-time in the summer after my graduation.
                            <br><br>
                            Shortly thereafter, my team was moved from WebRTC to the biggest
                            moneymaker of the company: Messaging. In our new department, we were in
                            charge of building out APIs for tracking the provisioning data for
                            various channels of automated text messaging. During my work here I
                            have gained valuable experience in developing services that aggregate
                            data from multiple external parties and are independently deployed.
                            <br><br>
                            I will always be thankful to Bandwidth for taking a chance on me as a
                            self-taught programmer right out of college.</p>

                            web-based application. The application's purpose was to track items in
                            a user's pantry and fridge and make suggestions for recipes based on
                            what is available. The CapTech intern program team did a fantastic job
                            of simulating a real-world consulting environment for creating the
                            application. I took charge of the API layer of the application to
